Read the week's guide for teaching material, then follow the global workflow below to submit your work.

---

## 🚀 How to Participate (read this once, then refer back)

**Fork it once at the start of the program** and do **all** your work — contest code and mini-projects — in your own fork. Each week's submissions go through two channels:

- **Contest** → the `csot` CLI (uploads directly to the autograder).
- **Mini-project** → submitted on the **contest portal** ([Mini-project submission page](https://csot-devops.devclub.in/submission) — paste your public repo URL).

### Step 0 — One-time setup: fork & clone

```bash
# 1. Click "Fork" (top-right of this repo) → fork it to your GitHub account.
#    You now have:   github.com/<your-username>/csot-devops   (your fork)
#    The original:   github.com/DevClub-IITD/csot-devops      (upstream)

# 2. Clone YOUR fork to your laptop:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/csot-devops.git
cd csot-devops

# 3. Add the original repo as "upstream" so you can pull new weekly content:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/3x3cu73/csot-devops.git
git remote -v   # should show: origin = your fork, upstream = the original

# 4. Each Monday, pull the new week's content from upstream into your fork:
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main          # or:  git rebase upstream/main
git push origin main             # update your fork on GitHub
```

> The fork is **your single workspace** for the entire 6-week program — contest attempts, mini-project work-in-progress, scratch scripts, notes. You never push anything back to this upstream repo. Mini-project deliverables are submitted on the **contest portal** — open the [Mini-project submission page](https://csot-devops.devclub.in/submission) and paste your public project repo URL.

### Where your work goes inside your fork

```text
csot-devops/                              ← YOUR fork
├── content/                              ← read-only; pulled from upstream
├── submission/
│   └── week-NN/                          ← contest code lives here
│       ├── 01.sh   02.sh   ...           ← graded by the `csot` CLI
│       └── ...
└── projects/
    └── week-NN/                          ← (optional) scratchpad for project drafts
                                          ← final project lives in its OWN public repo
                                          ← submit that repo URL via the form
```

### Per-week submission cycle

Every week you have **two deliverables**. They are graded independently and have different submit flows.


| Deliverable                  | Where you write code               | How you submit                                           | Where graded                                                              | Guide                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏆 **Contest** (autograded)  | `submission/week-NN/` in your fork | `csot submit ./submission/week-NN`                       | [csot-devops.devclub.in](https://csot-devops.devclub.in) (Docker sandbox) | `[/submission/README.md](./submission/README.md)`             |
| 📦 **Mini-project** (manual) | your **own public GitHub repo**    | [contest portal → **Mini-project submission**](https://csot-devops.devclub.in/submission) (paste repo URL) | manual mentor review                                                      | `[/projects/week-NN/README.md](./projects/week-01/README.md)` |


### Rules of the fork model

- **Never** commit secrets / `.env` files to your fork — even if it's private, it's still a GitHub repo. Run `trufflehog git file://. --only-verified` before pushing.
- **Keep your fork public** so mentors can audit your contest attempts and project work-in-progress if needed.
- For each mini-project, also create a **separate dedicated public repo** for the project itself (better portfolio piece than a folder inside the cohort fork). That dedicated repo's URL is what you put in the form.

## 💡 Project-First Philosophy

- Every week is built around **one buildable mini-project** + several alternative project ideas you can pick from
- Each project has a **🟢 Local Track** and a **🟡 Cloud Track (optional bonus)**
- Capstone in Week 6 ties everything together into one polished, deployable system
- **7 portfolio pieces** by the end — each with a public URL or demoable GitHub repo

---

## 💰 Cost

**Zero credit card required** for the local track of every week. The full program runs on:

- Your laptop (Linux / WSL / Mac)
- Free GitHub account (with free Actions runners + GHCR)
- Free Cloudflare account (DNS + Tunnels + Pages + Access)
- Free Terraform Cloud account (remote state)

Cloud bonuses (AWS / GCP / managed Kubernetes) are **optional** for students who have credits (AWS Educate, GitHub Student Pack, Oracle Free Tier, etc.).

---

## ⏱ Time Commitment

- ~7–9 hours/week, self-paced
- Async via the content repo; live sessions only for the kickoff, mid-program AMA, capstone kickoff, and demo day

---

## 🗓 Weekly Cadence

For each week (Week 1 first):

1. **Monday — sync your fork** with upstream (`git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main && git push`) to pull the new week's content.
2. **Mon–Wed — read** the matching `content/week-0N-*.md` guide; complete the modules and builds.
3. **Wed–Sat — contest**: solve the 12 tasks in `submission/week-NN/` of your fork; submit incrementally with `csot submit . -t NN` as you go. (Guide: `[/submission/README.md](./submission/README.md)`)
4. **Thu–Sun — mini-project**: build your DevOps Toolkit / weekly project in its **own public GitHub repo**, then submit the repo URL on the **contest portal** ([Mini-project submission page](https://csot-devops.devclub.in/submission)). (Guide: `[/projects/week-01/README.md](./projects/week-01/README.md)`)
5. **Sunday 11:59 PM IST — deadline** for both deliverables.

First-time setup (fork + clone + add upstream): see **[How to Participate](#-how-to-participate-read-this-once-then-refer-back)** above.
